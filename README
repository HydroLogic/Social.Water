GENERAL USE
The driver program is src/sw_driver.py
Customization required is to change the usr and pwd_encoded variables in sw_driver.py
In social.water.py, the class email_reader.__init__ the list of stations must be customized.
In social.water.py, the function parsemessages() must be adapted to specific locations.
Finally, in social.water.py, the function tz_adjust_EST_EDT() must be adapted for correct time zone.

The remaining codes and directory structure must remain as they are. The html and csv files in place are from 
the CrowdHydrology paper and included as examples - they should all be removed prior to deployment on another
project.
