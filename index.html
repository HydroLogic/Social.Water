<p>GENERAL USE
The driver program is src/sw_driver.py</p>

<p>An xml configuration file must be created to provide information about a specific site and related email account.
The file src/EXAMPLE_social.water.xml shows the format of such a configuration file.</p>

<p>To run the program, navigate to the src directory and run:
python sw_driver.py EXAMPLE_social.water.xml</p>

<p>The specific name of the xml file is provided as a command line argument as in the above example.</p>

<p>The remaining codes and directory structure must remain as they are. The html and csv files in place are from 
the CrowdHydrology paper and included as examples - they should all be removed prior to deployment on another
project.</p>
